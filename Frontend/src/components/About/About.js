                            Our web application gives users the chance to join a community that uses customer collaboration to promote brands,
                            suggest products, and offer a forum for direct dialogue between influencers and interested parties. The interested parties can take advantage of a variety of benefits, including speaking with existing customers or influencers,
                            learning in-depth about the product of interest, getting any queries resolved, and receiving the best quote on any insurance
                            Bajaj Allianz offers in all markets.</div>

                            Existing customers have the opportunity to become influencers on our website.
                            We have a special influencer programme that is essentially an incentive-based points-reward system,
                            wherein the influencer will receive a certain number of points for each interested party
                            that they convert into a customer as well as for performing product digital marketing activities, among other things.
                            These points will qualify you for incentives like cash, Amazon gift cards, and other goods.</div>
